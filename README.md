# Helium-Auto-Reboot-for-M5Stack

Here is the start of a M5Stack UIFlow to monitor your Helium hotspot and automatically reboot it if it goes off line.  You will need to edit the hotspot name.

This script is designed to control a [M5Stack ATOM Socket Kit" (HLW8023)](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-socket-kit-hlw8023-jp-us?variant=39295191744684).  The script will monitor a Helium Hotspot using the Helium API and will turn the hotspot off and back on automaticlly (rebooting it).

Helium-Auto-Reboot-for-M5Stack.m5f - this is the UIFlow source.
Helium-Auto-Reboot-for-M5Stack.py  - this is the generated python script.
